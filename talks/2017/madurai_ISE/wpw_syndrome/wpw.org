* Introduction

** What is WPW syndrome?
   - Constellation of findings in patients with an accessory pathway with bidirectional conduction
   - Delta wave and short PR = preexcitation = antegrade conduction
   - Palpitations / tachycardia = Orthodromic AVRT = retrograde conduction
   - WPW pattern / preexcitation pattern

* ECG findings

** Main ECG findings

   - Short PR interval
   - Delta wave

** The delta wave
   - Slurring of the initial part of the QRS
   - Fusion between conduction from pathway and AV conduction system
   - May be negative as well as positive
   - Contribution to QRS dependent on degree of fusion

** Delta wave

** Localization - Not important
   - V1 delta = ventricle of origin
   - Inferior leads = superior / inferior

** Differentiate delta wave from others
   - Short PR
   - Old MI
   - Slurring

* Management

** Problems
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px

** Risk of sudden death
   - Rapid ventricular rate during atrial arrhythmias
   - AV node behaves as natural defense 
   - AP - short refractory period, rapid conduction

** The low risk patient

** When to refer ?
   - Any patient with suspect / obvious preexcitation
   - Especially when history of palpitations
   - Urgently if there is history of syncope / preexcited AF

** Management of ORT
   - Adenosine
   - Other AV nodal blocking drugs

** Management of preexcited AF
   - Adenosine / beta blockers / calcium channel blockers should not be given
   - Amiodarone - (not considered safe)
   - Procainamide
   - DC cardioversion

** Ablation
   - Curative treatment for pathways in all locations
   - Success rate > 95% with low recurrence rate
   - Low risk of complications
