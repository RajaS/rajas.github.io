* Introduction

** Introduction
   - 50 to 60% of all pathways
   - Highest success rate
   - Lowest recurrence rate
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Interestingly right free wall and left free wall APs are opposite
in terms of frequency, success rate and recurrence rate
#+END_NOTES

** Points
   - Approach - Retrograde vs transseptal
   - Mapping - Coronary sinus
   - Mapping - Separating A and V
   - Difficult / failed ablations
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Points I am going to cover
#+END_NOTES

* Retrograde vs transseptal

** Approaches
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/both_approaches.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
One of the first decisions is to make is the approach. 
Transseptal and retrograde are possible
#+END_NOTES

** Retrograde or Transseptal - Evidence
   - Similar success rate
   - Similar procedure / fluoro time
   - More complications with retrograde approach

#+begin_reference
Manolis AS, Wang PJ, Estes NA 3rd. Radiofrequency ablation of left-sided accessory pathways: transaortic versus transseptal approach. Am Heart J. 1994 Nov;128(5):896-902. 
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Studies regarding this are mostly old.
Generally found similar success rates and procedure duration
Fluoro time and complications may be higher with retrograde
#+END_NOTES

** Choosing an approach
   - Personal preference
   - Train in both
   - May have to choose according to patient
     - Pediatric / Peripheral arterial disease / Aortic valve disease
     - Kyphoscoliosis
   - Transseptal - more mobility, less stability
   - Ready to switch
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Good to know both. 
One approach may be preferable in some patients
Most of the time it is personal preference
#+END_NOTES

* Coronary sinus

** CS located away from annulus

#+begin_reference
Shinbane JS, Lesh MD, Stevenson WG et al. Anatomic and electrophysiologic relation between the coronary sinus and mitral annulus: implications for ablation of left-sided accessory pathways. Am Heart J. 1998 Jan;135(1):93-8
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
CS is usually used as guide to map. But use it as a rough guide. 
Anatomically it doesnt always correspond to the annulus
#+END_NOTES

** CS LA connections
   [[./images/cs_la_connections.png]]

#+begin_reference
Chauvin M, Shah DC, Haïssaguerre M et al. The anatomic basis of connections between the coronary sinus musculature and the left atrium in humans. Circulation. 2000 Feb 15;101(6):647-52. 
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
And connections to LA are not continuous - they are discrete and variable
#+END_NOTES

** LA - CS block
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[./images/la_cs_block.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is well seen rarely like this when an extrastimulus blocks from LA to CS
This finding here confirms this is an endocardial connection
#+END_NOTES

** CS ventricular connections
   [[./images/CS_LV_pathway.png]]
   - About a third of all posteroseptal / left posterior APs
   - 70% of them had no diverticulum

#+begin_reference
Sun Y, Arruda M, Otomo K et al. Coronary sinus-ventricular accessory connections producing posteroseptal and left posterior accessory pathways: incidence and electrophysiological identification. Circulation. 2002;106(11):1362-7.
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
In contrast, connections may also exist from the CS to LV.
In our experience this is not as common as reported by Jackman's group
#+END_NOTES

* Mapping - Rhythm

** Mapping - Options
   - Atrial activation during ventricular pacing
     - Can intermittently check in sinus rhythm / atrial pacing
     - May have to pace from RVOT / LV
   - Ventricular activation during atrial pacing / sinus rhythm
   - Ablation during tachycardia
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Preferable is mapping atrial activation with ventricular pacing
Not possible when there is rapid conduction through AV conduction system
Mapping during tachycardia may be require in that case
#+END_NOTES

** RVOT pacing
   [[./images/pacing_rvot_rva.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Pacing from RVOT may help bring out pathway conduction
#+END_NOTES

** LV pacing
   [[./images/lv_pacing.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Rarely LV pacing may be needed, either endocardially or from CS branch
#+END_NOTES

** Entrained tachycardia
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[./images/entrained_tachycardia.jpg]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If ablating during tachycardia, pace from ventricle to entrain tachycardia before ablation.
This prevents catheter dislodgement upon tachycardia termination.

Note that this slide illustrates the third rule of entrainment - conduction block to a site for one paced beat followed by termination of tachycardia and activation of that site from a different direction with shorter activation time
#+END_NOTES

* Mapping - Differentiating A and V

** Separating A and V
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/mask1.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Practically a common challenge is to identify the atrial and ventricular components in a signal. Here what is this signal composed of?
#+END_NOTES

** Information from other electrodes
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/mask2.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Separate A and V in proximal bipole suggests both components may be there in distal EGM too
#+END_NOTES

** Unipolar
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/mask3.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Unipolar EGM is useful providing indication of timing of onset of V
#+END_NOTES

** Non preexcited beats
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/mask4.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Comparing with non preexcited beat allows clear identification of the components. 
This may happen because of intermittent loss of preexcitation or by using atrial extrastimuli to block in the AP
#+END_NOTES

** Mapping - Pseudodisappearance
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/pseudo_disappearance.png]]

#+begin_reference
Raja Selvaraj et al. Pseudodisappearance of atrial electrogram during accessory pathway ablation, EP Europace 2012;14(7):993
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Similarly while mapping A during ventricular pacing, a fortuitous beat with retrograde AP block shows us that there is an atrial signal which disappears during pathway conduction, indicating a good site with fused V and A
#+END_NOTES

** Simultaneous pacing
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
   [[./images/simul_pacing.png]]

#+begin_reference
Nakao, Seto, Iliev et al. Simultaneous Atrial and Ventricular Pacing to Facilitate Mapping of Concealed Left-Sided Accessory Pathways. PACE 2002; 25:922–928
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Simultaneous AV pacing has been described to help in this situation
#+END_NOTES

** Reversal of activation in oblique pathway
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 350px
   [[./images/oblique_reversal.jpg]]

#+begin_reference
Otomo K, Gonzalez MD, Jackman WM et al. Reversing the direction of paced ventricular and
atrial wavefronts reveals an oblique course in accessory AV pathways and improves
localization for catheter ablation. Circulation. 2001 Jul 31;104(5):550-6. 
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Left sided pathway are often oblique. Pacing from RVOT may change activation, allowing better identification of earliest atrial activation and recognition of an AP potential.
#+END_NOTES


* Difficult / failed ablations

** Reasons for failed ablation
   - Inability to position catheter at target site
   - Instability of catheter
   - Mapping error due to oblique course
   - Localisation errors
   - Epicardial location
   - Recurrent AF
   - Unusual locations

#+begin_reference
Morady F, Strickberger A, Man KC et al. Reasons for prolonged or failed attempts at radiofrequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways. J Am Coll Cardiol. 1996;27(3):683-9. 
#+end_reference

** Stability
   - Sheath
   - Catheter course
   - Retrograde approach
   - Pacing if possible
   - Entrain if during tachycardia

** Oblique pathways 
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
   [[./images/medial_both.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
In this patient, at this site V activation is early, but on V pacing A is late 
More laterally A was earlier indicating an atrial insertion that was more lateral
#+END_NOTES

** Oblique course
   - Misleading VA interval
   - Obscures AP potential
   - Change pacing location
   - Map for earliest activation (A/V)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
A key concept is to map for earliest atrial or ventricular activation when mappng atrial or ventricular insertion respectively and not going by shortest AV or VA alone. 
Trigger mode helps with this. 
#+END_NOTES

** Isthmus block
   [[./images/isthmus_block.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Sometimes during ablation, block can develop in the left sided isthmus resulting in change in CS activation. Need to map more laterally for the pathway.
#+END_NOTES

** Isthmus block
   [[./images/isthmus_block2.png]]

#+begin_reference

#+end_reference

** Isthmus block
   [[./images/isthmus_block1.png]]


** AF
   [[./images/palani_af_llap.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
AF may make mapping challenging, but in the presence of antegrade preexcitation, it is eminently possible. In this patient with rheumatic mitral valve disease, DC version wasnt an option, mapping was done during AF with successful ablation.
#+END_NOTES

** CS ventricular connection - CS muscle potential
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
   [[./images/nandhin_02_2015_cs_potential.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
A sharp CS potential is seen at successful site in CS connections.
#+END_NOTES

** LAA pathway
   [[./images/laa2.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
A relatively uncommon pathway connects from LAA to LV. 
#+END_NOTES

* Summary

** Summary
   - Left sided pathways in general are easiest to ablate and have best long term results
   - However, may occasionally present a challenge
   - Use of different pacing patterns to differentiate A and V
   - Mapping for earliest A / V
   - Use of unipolar mapping
   - Awareness of alternate pathway locations
