* Part I - Baseline evaluation (before inducing tachycardia)

** Narrow QRS tachycardia
   - Regular
   - Rate >= 100
   - QRSd <= 120
   - AT, AVNRT, orthodromic AVRT

** History
   - Age (at onset)
   - Sex
   - Neck pulsations
   - Onset / offset

** ECG
   - Long RP / Short RP
   - P wave axis
   - AV ratio
   - ST depression
   - QRS alternans

** EP study
   - Baseline measurements
   - Ventricular burst pacing
   - Ventricular extrastimuli
   - Atrial burst pacing
   - Atrial extrastimuli

** Ventricular pacing
   - Absent VA conduction
   - Eccentric atrial activation
   - Central atrial activation

** Atrial activation
   [[file:images/central.png]]

** VA conduction - Nodal conduction
   - Decremental
   - VA dependent on VH
   - Blocks with adenosine
   - VA time reduces with direct His capture

** VA and VH
   [[file:images/ccentral_vh_prolong.jpg]]

** Parahisian pacing
   - Somewhat difficult to perform
   - Often difficult to interpret
   - Still very useful sometimes

** Parahisian pacing - setting up
   - His catheter, slightly pushed in (small A)
   - Start with low output and increase gradually
   - Watch QRS morphology for intermittent His capture

** Parahisian pacing - interpretation
   - His capture - narrower QRS, His not seen, RVA early
   - Beware of atrial capture
   - Beware of pure His capture 
     - Narrower QRS
     - Isoelectric interval from pacing spike to QRS

** Parahisian pacing - interpretation
   - Identify beats with and without His capture
   - Look at atrial activation sequence
   - Measure VA interval    

** Parahisian pacing - with His capture
   - Nodal conduction - same sequence, shorter VA
   - AP conduction - same sequence, same VA
   - Mixed response - different sequence, shorter VA

** Atrial pacing
   - Latent preexcitation
   - Dual AV nodal physiology
     - PR > RR
     - AH jump

** PR more than RR
   [[file:images/pr_more_rr2.jpg]]

** AH jump - 600/430
   [[file:images/pre_RA600430.jpg]]
   
** AH jump - 600/420
   [[file:images/pre_RA600420.jpg]]

** AH jump - 600/410
   [[file:images/pre_RA600410.jpg]]

** Atrial extrastimulus - Atrioventricular AP
   [[file:images/atrio_vent_pac.jpg]]

** Atrial extrastimulus - Atriofascicular AP
   [[file:images/atrio_fasc_pac.png]]
   
** Atrial extrastimulus - Fasciculoventricular AP 
   [[file:images/fasciculo_vent_pac.jpg]]

** Other maneuvers
** Response to adenosine

** Differential pacing
   - VA interval during pacing from apex and base
   - Shorter from apex for nodal conduction
   - Shorter from base for AP conduction
** RV apex pacing

** RV base pacing

* Part II - Evaluation of tachycardia

** Regular narrow QRS tachycardia
   - AVNRT
   - Orthodromic AVRT
   - Atrial tachycardia

** Tachycardia induction
   - Chamber from which induced
   - Induction dependent on critical AH prolongation
   - Induction dependent on antegrade AP conduction block

** Regular narrow QRS tachycardia
   - A/V ratio
   - Atrial activation
   - VA time
   - Ventricular overdrive pacing

** Narrow QRS tachycardia, 1:1 VA, eccentric atrial activation
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[file:images/preexc_ort.jpg]]

** Narrow QRS tachycardia, 1:1 VA, central atrial activation, very short VA
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[file:images/typical_avnrt.jpg]]

** Narrow QRS tachycardia, 1:1 VA, central atrial activation, VA > 70 ms

** SVT

** Differentiating features
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[file:images/essential_parts.gif]]

** Differentiating features
   - Chamber essential to circuit
   - Focal / reentry
   - Extranodal pathway
   - VA linking
   - Distance from RV apex

** Sequential vs simultaneous activation
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
[[file:images/seq_parallel.jpg]]

** RV overdrive pacing - most useful maneuver
   - Easy to perform and interpret
   - Can distinguish AT from AVNRT / AVRT (VAAV versus VAV)
   - Can distinguish between AVNRT / AVRT (cPPI-TCL, SA-VA)
   - Onset of entrainment can provide clues
   - Can help even if not entrained !

** Setting up
   - Burst pacing from right ventricle - apex / base
   - Sync on
   - Tachycardia CL - 30 ms
   - Pace until atrium entrained
   - Stop pacing

** What to look for ?
   - Don't 'eyeball'
   - Does tachycardia continue ?
   - Was the atrium entrained ?
   - Which is the last entrained A ?
   - Sequence - VAV or VAAV

** What to look for ?
   - corrected PPI - TCL
   - SA - VA
   - Is there fusion during entrainment ?
   - Beginning of entrainment - A or His ?
   - How many beats to entrain ?

** Fusion during entrainment ?
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[file:images/fusion.jpg]]

** Entrainment
    [[file:images/VOP_entrainment.jpg]]

** Beginning of entrainment can give a clue
   [[file:images/entrainment_onset.jpg]]
    - Atrial acceleration in transition zone
    - A entrainment before H entrainment

** Could not entrain - useful information ?
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
   [[file:images/av_dissociation.jpg]]

** Summary
   - VAAV identifies AT, VAV rules out
   - SA - VA and PPI - TCL are longer for AVNRT
   - Can use basal pacing if responses are equivocal
   - A entrained earlier for AVRT, entrained before His

** His refractory PVC
   - Little more difficult to perform and interpret
   - Very useful maneuver
   - Especially differentiate septal AP from AVNRT

** His refractory PVC - setting up
   - R synchronised single extrastimuli
   - Check that sync is working
   - Start 30 ms less than RR
   - Decrement by 10 ms
   - Continue until refractoriness or tachycardia termination

** His refractory PVC - measurement and interpretation
   - Confirm cycle length is stable
   - Measure AA around each PVC to find longest CI at which PVC preexcites A
   - Decide if His is refractory at this time

** His refractory PVCs - responses
   - Advance atrial activation without change in sequence
   - Delay atrial activation without change in sequence
   - Terminate tachycardia without conduction to atrium
   - Does not alter atrial activation

** Other clues during narrow QRS tachycardia
   - VA unlinking - spontaneous or after atrial burst
   - Cycle length and VA changes with bundle branch block
   - Spontaneous termination

** Summary
   - Understanding of basic electrophysiology of arrhythmias
   - Practice is important
   - Although not required at most time, will prove critical in select cases
