#+TITLE: Tachycardia Induced Cardiomyopathy
#+AUTHOR: Raja Selvaraj, JIPMER

* What are we doing to discuss?
  - What is TIC and what is the mechanism?
  - Common causes
  - Management
  - PVC mediated cardiomyopathy
  - Atrial fibrillation
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is a brief talk
#+END_NOTES

* What is Tachycardia induced Cardiomyopathy
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Heart failure
   - Systolic dysfunction
   - ? Diastolic dysfunction
   - Due to prolonged elevated heart rate (> 100)
   - Reversible on control of arrhythmia
#+BEGIN_NOTES
reversibility is key, which also means diagnosis is always provisional until lv function improves
#+END_NOTES

* What are the usual causes
  - SVT
    - Focal AT /  A flutter 
    - AVNRT / AVRT / PJRT 
  - VT
    - RVOT VT 
    - ILVT 
  - Misc
    - AF 
    - PVCs
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Practically the common causes are AT, AFl, AF and ILVT
#+END_NOTES


* Mechanisms
  - Myocardial energy depletion
  - Myocardial ischemia
  - Abnormal calcium handling
  - Cellular and extracellular matrix remodeling


* Sequence of events 
  [[file:images/dilated_heart.png]]
  - Cardiac dilatation, MR
  - Elevated filling pressures
  - wall thinning, decreased contractility
  - heart failure, neurohormonal activation

* Clinical features
  - Any age (hydrops due to flutter)
  - Obvious in many patients
  - May need a high index of suspicion in some
  - Diagnosis may be confirmed only after reversal of LV dysfunction

* Diagnosis
  - May be easy
    - Atrial flutter, 2:1 conduction, LV dysfunction
    - PJRT with LV dysfunction
  - May be uncertain
    - Atrial fibrillation with heart failure
    - Post MI, LV dysfunction with PVCs
  - Benefit of doubt
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Diagnosis tends to be straightforward or tricky. 
Important to give benefit of doubt since reversibility is rare in cardiomyopathies
#+END_NOTES

* Management
  - SVT - ablation
  - Idiopathic VT - ablation
  - AF - rate control / rhythm control
  - Initial improvement seen as early as 24 hours
  - Most recovery within one month
  - Near normalisation in one year
#+BEGIN_NOTES
SVT and idiopathic VT are easy to ablate and this should be the choice of treatment
Rate or rhythm control strategies are possible in AF
#+END_NOTES

* PVCs
  - Repetitive dyssynchronous activation and not true tachycardia
  - Only small fraction develop cardiomyopathy
    - Related to burden / frequency, but no clear cut-off (10000, 20000, 16%, 20%, 24%)
    - PVC QRS duration > 140 ms / 150 ms
    - PVC coupling interval < 600 ms 
    - Interpolation 
#    - PVC coupling interval < 600 ms (Int J Cardiovasc Imaging 2003;19:295),
#    - Interpolation (Heart rhythm 2011;8:1046) - weak evidence
#  - 16%, 20%, 24% (AJP 1996;271:R1529, JCE 2011;22:663, Heart rhythm 2010;7:865)
#    - 10000, 20000 (Heart 2009;95:1230, JCE 2011;22:791, ANE 2008;13:81)
#    - PVC QRS duration > 140 ms / 150 ms (JCE 2011;22:791, Heart Rhythm 2012;9:1460)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Burden as denoted by number of freq of PVCs have correlated with incidence of LV dysfunction
Varying cut-offs have been proposed, but obviously, there is no magic number
other important factors might be PVC QRS duration, PVC coupling interval and interpolation

* AF - an underrecognised cause ?
  - Arrhythmia in first reported case in 1913
  - Heart failure / LV dysfunction often attributed to other causes
  - Irregularity of response may contribute ? 
#  - Irregularity of response may contribute ? (AJC 1996;78:1431, JCE 2007;18:9)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
An interesting hypothesis, never clearly established, is that AF may also result in cardiomyopathy in absence of fast ventricular rate. 
#+END_NOTES

* DCM with arrhythmia or arrhythmia with TIC
   - LV dimension may help differentiate
   - BNP / LVEF not different, but LV size smaller (1)
   - LVEDD < 66 predicts TIC (2)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
A dilemma. LV size seems to be best predictor of probabiliy of improvement of LV function when treating AF.
#+END_NOTES


* PVI or Ablate and PACE
  - Atypical flutter / AF - Often refractory to pharmacologic therapy
  - AVN ablation with pacing can be an excellent alternative
  - In an experienced center, PVI may be superior ?
  - Recurrences can result in rapid deterioration 
# avn ablation can improve function in AF (Twidale PACE 1993;16:1275, Brignole AJC 1994;74:242)

  [[file:images/paba_chf.jpg]]
# multicenter US study
# PVI versus AV node ablation with BiV pacing
# 40 patients in each arm
# suspiciously poor results in ablate and pace group
# findings may not apply to less experienced centers

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Multicenter study with 40 patients in each arm suggested that PVI has better outcomes than AV node ablation with BiV pacing
But results in ablate and pace group are suspiciously poor.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Previous studies have consistently shown good results with ablate and pace strategy (even without CRT.) That has been our experience too.
#+END_NOTES

* Points to Ponder
  - Component of TIC in post MI PVCs (1)
  - Easier to ablate (2)
  - MR sensitive marker of improvement
  - Risk of sudden death (3) - role for vest?
  - Late deaths
