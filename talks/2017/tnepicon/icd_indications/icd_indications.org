#+TITLE: Indications for ICD therapy
#+AUTHOR: Raja Selvaraj, JIPMER

* Sudden death
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - About a 1000 people attending this conference
 - One of us is likely to die suddenly in the next one year (1)
 - Most likely to happen outside the hospital
 - Rhythm is VF if recorded within 4 minutes (2)
 - We could implant ICDs in everyone to prevent that death
 - Or we could learn to identify those most likely to benefit

#+BEGIN_NOTES
ICD indications is all about refining selection so that most sudden deaths are prevented with least implants. Its more about knowing when not to implant a device!

* Case 1
  - Two patients and one ICD
  - 40 M, Sustained VT, old MI, LVEF 35%, NYHA I
  - 40 M, MI 1 yr back, LVEF 25%, NYHA I
  - Who gets the ICD ?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
So, if you have these two patients, but for some reason can give a device to only one, whom would you choose?
#+END_NOTES

* Secondary prevention vs primary prevention
  How much better is NNT ?
  - 2 times (half)
  - 3 times (third)
  - 5 times
  - 10 times
#+BEGIN_NOTES
So, you guessed that secondary prevention is more important than primary prevention. So what is the factor by which the NNTs are different, roughly?
#+END_NOTES

* NNT in ICD trials
| Trial           | Mortality(3yrs) | NNT(3yrs) |
|-----------------+-----------------+-----------|
| MADIT2          |              31 |        11 |
| SCD-HeFT (ICM)  |              28 |        18 |
| SCD-HeFT (NICM) |            15.8 |        25 |
|-----------------+-----------------+-----------|
| MADIT           |              42 |         4 |

|-----------------+-----------------+-----------|
| AVID            |            35.9 |         9 |
| CIDS            |              27 |        27 |
| CASH            |              39 |        13 |
| Metaanalysis    |              32 |        13 |

#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Surprise! The NNT in primary prevention trials is almost the same as those in the secondary prevention trials. Illustrates the importance of EF over anything else. Add to it the fact that AVID patients had unstable VT/VF and poor beta blocker use in the drug group.
#+END_NOTES

* ACC guidelines
  - LV dysfunction / prior MI / at least 40 days post-MI / LVEF less than or equal to 30% / NYHA functional Class I. (Class I Level of Evidence: A)
  - Structural heart disease / spontaneous sustained VT /  Hemodynamically stable or unstable. - (Class I Level of Evidence: B)
#+BEGIN_NOTES
And the guidelines also favor the primary prevention patient as having more evidence towards a class I indication than the secondary prevention patient. 
#+END_NOTES

* Case 2
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none none appear)
   - 36 male, AWMI
   - VF on second day - defibrillated
   - LVEF 30%

* Family apprehensive, what would you do?
  - ICD for secondary prevention?
  - ICD for primary prevention?

* Primary VF - No indication for ICD
  - Related to reversible trigger
  - Does not affect long term outcome
  - ICD implant not indicated on this basis

* Primary prevention?
  - MADIT 2 requires 40 days post MI
  - Early ICD implant not shown to be beneficial

* ICD early post MI

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Trials of early ICD implant have consistently shown no benefit.
#+END_NOTES

* Outcome?
  - What is his prognosis?
  - What would you do

* Not benign !
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - AIVR - benign
   - Primary VF - poor acute outcome
   - But does not impact long term outcome


** Fast MI registry - 5 year analysis of outcomes
   [[file:images/fast_mi_front.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
French registry of patients with AMI.
Provides best longitudinal data on these patients
#+END_NOTES

** Higher early mortality
   [[file:images/fast_mi_early_mortality.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
In hospital mortality is high
#+END_NOTES

** Long term outcome not affected
   [[file:images/fast_mi_late_mortality.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
But long term survival not different
#+END_NOTES

** What would you do?
   - Revascularization
   - Beta blockers
   - Early risk stratification ?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Revascularization and use of beta blockers are perhaps most important. May be a role for early risk stratification with holter monitoring and VT induction.
#+END_NOTES

** Appropriate use criteria for ICD implant
   [[file:images/appropriate_early_vt.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
AUC suggest possible role for ICD when 
 - EF is low
 - Recurrent VF
 - Persistent NSVT
 - Inducible VT
 - revascularization not possible
#+END_NOTES

** Wearable defibrillator
   # people are worried
   [[file:images/wearable_defib.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Wearable defibrillator may play a role in these situations
Provide safety net for a period until decision regarding ICD is clearer
#+END_NOTES


* Case 3
  - 75 year old male
  - Old MI
  - LVEF 30%, NYHA III
  - Creat 2.2, BUN 45
  - RBBB, QRSd 140 ms
  - Persistent atrial fibrillation

* ICD advised elsewhere
  - ICD indicated as per guidelines
  - Can you deny ICD because of age?
  - What would you advise?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
By guidelines, he qualifies for an ICD. And age or other comorbidities are not contraindications unless they significantly affect his longevity.
#+END_NOTES

* HF severity and benefit
   [[./images/levy_scdheft.jpg]]

#+begin_reference
Levy et al. Circulation 2009;120:835-842
#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
As a general rule, sicker patients benefit less.
#+END_NOTES

* Other risk markers and U curve
  Goldenberg - MADIT II
  - Age > 70 yrs
  - NYHA > II
  - BUN > 26 mg/dl
  - QRS d > 120 ms
  - Atrial fibrillation

#+begin_reference
Goldenberg et al. JACC 2008;51:288-296

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Suggested U shaped curve with most benefit in those with 1-3 risk factors
Longer follow up showed benefit in low risk group also. 
Other risk scores are FADES and Seattle Heart Failure Model

  Seattle Heart Failure Model may be a better predictor

* Case 4 
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - 45 M
  - Old AWMI
  - LVEF 32%, NYHA II
  - 20% PVCs, short NSVT on holter
  - What would you advise

* Is there an indication for ICD?
  - LVEF < 30%, NYHA I (MADIT 2)
  - LVEF < 35%, NYHA II-III (SCD-HeFT)
  - EP study (MADIT / MUSTT)
  - ICD implant ?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Not a candidate by MADIT II criteria, but yes by SCD-HeFT criteria. Might also consider under MADIT I or MUSTT criteria if inducible VT is present.
#+END_NOTES

* Ablation of PVCs

#+end_reference
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Even in structural heart disease, there may be a component of reversible cardiomyopathy due to PVCs. 
#+END_NOTES

* May obviate need for ICD implant!
  [[file:images/pvc_ablation2.png]]

* Case 5
  - 28 year old male
  - Recurrent syncope

* ECG
  [[file:images/lqts2.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
QT prolongation consistent with LQTS
#+END_NOTES

* Management?
  - Lifestyle modification
  - Beta blockers
  - Sympathectomy
  - ICD implantation

* ICD implant in LQTS
  - Syncope or VT while receiving beta blockers (IIa)
  - Doing well 4 years later, on high dose beta blockers
#+BEGIN_NOTES
No need to hurry with ICD despite initial malignant presentation. Only non response to beta blockers necessitates ICD
#+END_NOTES

* Conclusion - When not to implant an ICD
  - Expected survival with good functional status < 1 yr
  - Incessant VT / VF
  - Drug refractory class IV failure, not candidate for CRT / transplant
  - VT / VF amenable to ablation
  - Arrhythmias due to completely reversible cause
