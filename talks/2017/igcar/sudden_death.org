** Sudden cardiac death
*** SCD - what is it and why is it important
    - Unexpected, natural death from cardiac causes (< 24 h)
    - Significant contributor to all deaths in the West
    - About 10% of all deaths in the community

*** Why not sufficient?
    - Cost of device implantation
    - Only 15-20% of patients with CAD will have sudden death
    - LV ejection fraction is a marker of risk
    - But only one component of a probably multifactorial risk profile
    - NNT about 15 over 3 years with EF alone
    - Many deaths in patients with EF > 30%

*** ECG
    [[file:images/ecg.png]]

*** ECG signature
    - Electrocardiogram is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart
    - Encodes the rhythm, depolarization, repolarization
    - Should carry information regarding risk of sudden death

*** Premature Ventricular beats
    [[file:images/pvc.jpg]]
    - Beats that originate in the ventricles
    More abnormal beats - worse the outcome

*** Heart rate variability (HRV)

    - Most patients dont get ICDs - Surrogate vs true outcomes
    - Datasets / Modeling tools

*** Study in JIPMER
    - 58 patients
    - LV dysfunction post MI (LVEF < 40%)
    - Multiple parameters measured at baseline
    - Followed up for 2 years

*** Outcomes
    - Mean age 46.8 yrs
    - 7/58 died suddenly
    - PVCs, HRV, TWA, HRT were not predictive
    - EF was strongest predictor

*** The future
    - New markers ?
    - Better measurement methods
    - Combine markers

Abstract
Sudden cardiac death is an unexpected natural death from cardiac causes, usually due to a rapid heart rhythm. This is the cause of about 10% of all deaths in the community. Most of these occur in patients who have had a heart attack before. Implantation of a defibrillator can save these lives, but the challenge has been to identify those at risk. Since sudden death is a disorder of the heart's electrical rhythm, there has been a search for an electrical signature for sudden death. This has been a ripe area for collaboration between engineers with interest in signal processing and physicians. This talk will cover the different signatures that have been investigated and their current status in identifying patients at risk.
