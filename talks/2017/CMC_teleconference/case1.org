#+BEGIN_NOTES
Reading books helps you start off on a subject, but is least productive in long term
Hearing someone teach is better, and it gets better when teaching is richly visual
Unfortunately this is where it stops most of the time

Active forms of learning are more productive. 
Participation is important
Our secret - teaching / giving a talk are good ways of learning
Best - do it yourself

Simulations serve the purpose. 
Case in box - More useful than live cases
Regular, day to day cases better than unusual / interesting cases

* Socratic method

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The socratic method of teaching 
Questioning to make the student think rather than telling them things
#+END_NOTES

* Presentation
  - Middle aged female
  - Episodic palpitations
  - Documented narrow QRS tachycardia
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Given the demographics, most likely to be AVNRT.
Next common would be AVRT followed by AT

Earliest atrial activation is in CS 7-8

#+BEGIN_NOTES
All patients have a left sided endocardial AP with LA to CS connection medially

A. Lateral AP - atrial activation is dis to prox, cs is prox to dis
B. posterolateral AP - atrial early at CS 4-5
C. Posteroseptal AP - concordant activation

 [[file:images/04_a_extra_tachy_induction.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Tachycardia induction with PR prolongation
Tachycardia with short VA and central activation - what is first measurement?
Anything to rule out AT ? (wobble, activation same as with RV pacing)
What is best maneuver to perform here?
#+END_NOTES

* Ventricular burst pacing
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 900
 [[file:images/05_vop_termination.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Why VOP is best?
Tachycardia terminates - now what? (look at onset of pacing, isoprenaline)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
What to look for? (A entrainment in transition zone? after how many beats? HH vs AA)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Early PVC doesnt preexcite. 
What is the interpretation - is a ap ruled out?
Is this a His refractory PVC ? (How do you generally identify His refractoriness)
#+END_NOTES

* PVC by coupling interval
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
  [[file:images/PVCs.jpg]]

* Summarise so far
  - Regular NQRST
  - Central atrial activation, VA 70
  - VOP terminates
  - His refractory PVCs dont preexcite
  - What next? 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
What can be checked in sinus rhythm?
#+END_NOTES


* Parahisian
#+ATTR_HTML: :class caliper-image :img-length 2500
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 600 :width 900
  [[file:images/08_parahisian.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Parahisian - what is approach?
  - Exclude direct atrial capture
  - Is activation similar
  - Is VA time similar
What are the findings in this patient (SA difference of 10 ms)
What is possible cause of difference ? (shorter SV time due to activation from HPS)
Which is better to measure - SA / VA
What difference expected for AV nodal conduction
#+END_NOTES

  [[file:images/09_vop_iso.jpg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Finally VOP with isoprenaline - tachycardia continues. What is approach?
   - Confirm atrial overdrive
   - identify last entrained A
   - sequence
   - PPI - TCL (correction)
   - SA - VA
#+END_NOTES

* Where are we ?
  - Parahisian confirms presence of concealed AP
  - VOP confirms AVRT
  - What approach to map?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Concealed - so have to map early A
Map in tachycardia if close to AV conduction
Where to map? - septum from rt side?, within CS?, in LA?
#+END_NOTES

Difference between atrial activation in His and earliest CS electrogram can give a clue to location
In Grp IA, successful ablation was in right posteroseptal region or within proximal CS
In Grp IB, ablation was in left atrium endocardially
