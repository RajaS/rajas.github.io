* Introduction

** Narrow QRS tachycardia
   - Regular, rate > 100, QRSd < 120
   - AT, AVNRT, orthodromic AVRT
   - Preexcitation in sinus rhythm / with atrial pacing
   - Dual AV nodal physiology
   - Manner of induction
# ** Pacing maneuvers
#    - Why do pacing maneuvers ?
#    - Does not provide critical information in about 80% of the cases
** Narrow QRS tachycardia, central atrial activation, very short VA

# ** Romance of EP
#    - Difference from ECG (sit and watch)
#    - Do in each case
#    - Know your enemy
** General approach
   - What is the situation ?
   - What are the differential diagnoses ?
   - What are the electrophysiologic differences ?
   - What pacing maneuvers can differentiate ?
** How to do
   - Setup the stimulator
   - How to measure
   - How to interpret
   - Practice 
* Scenarios
** Commonest Setting
   - Regular narrow QRS tachycardia
   - 1:1 VA
   - Atrial activation central
   - VA > 70 ms
** SVT
   [[file:images/svt.jpg]]

** Differential diagnoses (important ones)
   - AVNRT
   - Orthodromic AVRT
   - Atrial tachycardia
** EP differences
   - A / V essential to tachycardia
   - Focal versus reentry 
   - Presence of extranodal pathway
   - VA linking
   - Distance of circuit from RV apex
   - V and A activation - serial versus simultaneous

** Pacing maneuvers
   Single most useful maneuver ?
** RV overdrive pacing - most useful maneuver
   - Easy to perform and interpret
   - Can distinguish AT from AVNRT / AVRT (VAAV versus VAV)
   - Can distinguish between AVNRT / AVRT (cPPI-TCL, SA-VA)
   - Onset of entrainment can provide clues
   - Can help even if not entrained !
** Setting up
   - Burst pacing from right ventricle
   - Sync on
   - Tachycardia CL - 30 ms
   - Pace until atrium entrained
   - Stop pacing
** What to look for ?
   - Don't 'eyeball'
   - Does tachycardia continue ?
   - Was the atrium entrained ?
   - Which is the last entrained A ?
   - Sequence - VAV or VAAV
** What to look for ?
   - corrected PPI - TCL
   - SA - VA
   - Is there fusion during entrainment ?
   - Beginning of entrainment - A or His ?
   - How many beats to entrain ?
** RV pacing in narrow QRS tachycardia - Rule out (or in) AT

** Entrainment
    [[file:images/VOP_entrainment.jpg]]
** Beginning of entrainment can give a clue
   [[file:images/entrainment_onset.jpg]]
    - Atrial acceleration in transition zone
    - A entrainment before H entrainment
** Could not entrain - useful information ?

** Summary
   - VAAV identifies AT, VAV rules out
   - SA - VA and PPI - TCL are longer for AVNRT
   - Can use basal pacing if responses are equivocal
   - A entrained earlier for AVRT, entrained before His
** His refractory PVC
   - Little more difficult to perform and interpret
   - Very useful maneuver
   - Especially differentiate septal AP from AVNRT
** His refractory PVC - setting up
   - R synchronised single extrastimuli
   - Check that sync is working
   - Start 30 ms less than RR
   - Decrement by 10 ms
   - Continue until refractoriness or tachycardia termination
** His refractory PVC - measurement and interpretation
   - Confirm cycle length is stable
   - Measure AA around each PVC to find longest CI at which PVC preexcites A
   - Decide if His is refractory at this time
** His refractory PVCs - responses
   - Advance atrial activation without change in sequence
   - Delay atrial activation without change in sequence
   - Terminate tachycardia without conduction to atrium
   - Does not alter atrial activation

** Other clues during narrow QRS tachycardia
   - VA unlinking - spontaneous or after atrial burst
   - Cycle length and VA changes with bundle branch block
   - Spontaneous termination

** Maneuver in sinus rhythm - Central VA conduction with ventricular pacing
** Scenario 
   Central VA conduction
** Setting
   - During ventricular pacing, 1:1 VA conduction
   - Central atrial activation
** Differential diagnoses
   - Nodal conduction
   - Septal accessory pathway
** EP differences
    - Decremental conduction
    - His is a waypoint
    - Distal insertion (entry point)
    - Adenosine sensitivity
** Decremental single ventricular extrastimuli
   - Easy to perform (must be routine)
   - Atrial activation pattern
   - VA interval - Decremental conduction
   - VA relation to VH
** Setting up and measurements
   - Pace from RV apex
   - His catheter and RA / CS catheters
   - Decrement by 10-20 ms
   - VA interval measured to earliest A
** Decremental conduction
   - Classical property of nodal conduction
   - Can also be seen with AP
   - How to differentiate

** Parahisian pacing
   - Somewhat difficult to perform
   - Often difficult to interpret
   - Still very useful sometimes
** Parahisian pacing
   [[file:images/parahisian_explanation.jpg]]
** Parahisian pacing - setting up
   - His catheter, slightly pushed in (small A)
   - Start with low output and increase gradually
   - Watch QRS morphology for intermittent His capture
** Parahisian pacing - interpretation
   - His capture - narrower QRS, His not seen, RVA early
   - Beware of atrial capture
   - Beware of pure His capture 
     - Narrower QRS
     - Isoelectric interval from pacing spike to QRS
** Parahisian pacing - interpretation
   - Identify beats with and without His capture
   - Look at atrial activation sequence
   - Measure VA interval    
** Parahisian pacing - with His capture
   - Nodal conduction - same sequence, shorter VA
   - AP conduction - same sequence, same VA
   - Mixed response - different sequence, shorter VA

** Differential pacing
   - VA interval during pacing from apex and base
   - Shorter from apex for nodal conduction
   - Shorter from base for AP conduction
** RV apex pacing

** Summary
   - Understanding of basic electrophysiology of arrhythmias
   - Practice is important
   - Although not required at most time, will prove critical in select cases
